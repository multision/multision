## 🎮 Fun Facts  
- I’m focused on preserving modding history by porting legacy Forge mods with accuracy.  
- I treat UI/UX like art direction — custom layouts, transitions, and smooth user flows are non-negotiable.  
- I’m fascinated by the jailbreak scene and experiment with new ways to sideload and deploy apps on-demand.
